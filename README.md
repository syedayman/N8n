# n8n AI Customer Support Agent
An AI Agent workflow developed in n8n that identifies if incoming emails are customer support related, and if they are, the agent will draft a response for you in the email thread so all you have to do is review it and send it off. The agent accesses your policies and FAQs via a Pinecone vector database so you know you can trust its response.
